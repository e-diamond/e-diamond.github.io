Hi, I'm <span class="txt-accent">Beth</span>.

I make things on the internet â€” like this website!

<!-- See a list of my other projects below, or keep scrolling to see some of my blog posts (visit my [blog]({{ "blog" | absolute_url }}) to see some more!).  -->
See my other projects below, or play with the animation in the background! (There are some more controls at the bottom of this page!)

<!-- The animation playing in the background shows a [ball-and-stick model][ball-and-stick] of the [face-centred cubic][fcc] crystal system. That's the [crystal structure of **<span class="txt-accent">Diamond</span>**][diamond-cubic]! Each of the spheres represents a carbon atom. You can use your mouse (or your finger!) to move it around, or check out the bottom of this page for some extra controls! -->
